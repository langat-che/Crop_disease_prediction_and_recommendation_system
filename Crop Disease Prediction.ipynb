        "Agriculture remains the backbone of many economies, particularly in developing regions. However, pests and diseases significantly impact crop yields, often going undetected until it's too late. Farmers frequently rely on experience or guesswork, leading to misdiagnosis and excessive pesticide use. This not only reduces productivity but also harms the environment and increases costs.\n",

        "Modern AI technologies can bridge this gap by enabling early, accurate detection of plant diseases and pests ‚Äî and offering tailored treatment recommendations. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning models trained on real-world agricultural datasets like `TOM2024`, we can help farmers make informed, timely decisions.\n",
