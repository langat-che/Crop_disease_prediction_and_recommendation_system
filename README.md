# Crop Disease Prediction AI
## Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-driven system to detect and classify crop diseases from leaf images, specifically targeting maize, tomato, and onion. Utilizing a fine-tuned InceptionV3 and Custom CNN deep learning model, the system not only identifies diseases but also provides tailored treatment and prevention recommendations, aiming to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early disease detection and management.

### üß™ Modeling
To classify crop diseases from images, we experimented with two primary convolutional models:
| Model           | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Custom CNN**  | A manually designed CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers   |
| **InceptionV3** | A pre-trained, deep architecture known for handling multi-scale features |

---
### üèóÔ∏è Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing
- Image resizing (typically to 299x299 for InceptionV3)
- Normalization and augmentation (horizontal flip, rotation, zoom)
2. Model Training
- Custom CNN trained from scratch
- InceptionV3 used transfer learning with ImageNet weights
- Fine-tuning applied to top layers of InceptionV3
- Early stopping and learning rate decay applied
3. Evaluation
- Dataset split: 80% training, 20% validation
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- Confusion matrix plotted for class-wise performance

### üèÜ Performance Summary
| Model       | Accuracy  | F1 Score   | Remarks                               |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Custom CNN  | \~85%     | \~0.83     | Lightweight, but less accurate        |
| InceptionV3 | **\~91%** | **\~0.89** | Best performer, strong generalization |

### Visualizations
The notebooks/ directory contains Jupyter notebooks with:
- Training and validation accuracy/loss plots.
- Confusion matrices.
- Sample predictions with corresponding recommendations.

### Recommendation Engine
Upon predicting the disease class, the system provides:
- Treatment Suggestions: Recommended pesticides or fungicides.
- Preventive Measures: Best practices to prevent disease recurrence.
- Agronomic Tips: Additional advice tailored to the specific crop and disease.

### Model Architecture
Base Model: InceptionV3 pre-trained on ImageNet.
Fine-Tuning: Unfrozen top layers for domain-specific feature learning.
Additional Layers:
- Global Average Pooling
- Dropout (0.5)
- Dense layer with softmax activation for classification.

## Conclusion
This AI-powered system demonstrates the potential of deep learning in agriculture, offering a practical solution for early detection and management of crop diseases. By integrating advanced image classification with actionable recommendations, it serves as a valuable tool for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.

## Recommendations
- Data Expansion: Incorporate more diverse datasets to improve model generalization.
- Mobile Integration: Develop a mobile application for on-field disease detection.
- Real-Time Updates: Implement a system for updating the model with new data to adapt to emerging diseases.
